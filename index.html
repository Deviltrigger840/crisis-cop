      <h1>CrisisCop: Intelligent Security Patrol Robot</h1>
      <p>
        The research endeavors to develop an effective and scalable patrol robot
        system that is capable of dealing with dynamic settings with enhanced
        adaptability and wisdom. It combines path adjustment through
        reinforcement learning-based method, LIDAR-SLAM for avoiding obstacles,
        and GPS-Waypoint navigation for adaptive traversing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system further suggests a sensor-based approach for adaptive patrol
        routes, predicted weather conditions, air quality, and body health
        parameters. The system accommodates seamless collaboration between slave
        robots using real-time communication and decision-making operations,
        assigning them in accordance with location, battery, and environmental
        parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Real-time decision-making, proactive response, and optimal utilization
        of resources are ensured using Edge Computing, IoT, and Machine Learning
        (ML) techniques.

      <h2>Research Framework</h2>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Aimed to design an autonomous outdoor patrol robot that can travel in
        the diverse terrain and weather conditions while being very reliable. In
        operation, real-time environmental analysis has adapted to these
        physical systems. These are designed for various groups including
        security teams, facility managers, or organizations seeking scalable
        surveillance solutions. The challenges in multi-sensor fusion algorithms
        involve the handling of missing and noisy data. It implements a strong
        algorithm that can make meaningful insights even from incomplete or
        unreliable data, hence enhancing the ability of the robots to make
        accurate environmental predictions for optimum performance. For now, the
        functionalities are being simulated with python.
      </p>

      <h3>Literature Survey</h3>
      <p>
        This project enhances slave robots' adaptability by integrating external
        environmental data (e.g., gas, humidity, pressure) with internal health
        metrics (e.g., voltage, temperature) for proactive maintenance and
        real-time response. Unlike past studies, it introduces short-term
        environmental forecasting and dynamic power optimization based on
        environmental stressors. Combining sensor fusion with traction control
        and alert systems, it creates a holistic, adaptive robot system for
        resilient operation in diverse and changing warehouse conditions.
      </p>

      <h3>Research Gap</h3>
      <p>
        Most patrol robots lack real-time adaptation to changing environments
        and don’t combine environmental monitoring with internal health checks.
        CrisisCop fills this gap by integrating both for smarter, proactive
        patrols in dynamic warehouse settings.
      </p>

      <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
      <p>
        Traditional patrol systems struggle with adaptability, decision-making,
        and coordination in dynamic environments. This causes inefficiencies in
        navigation, monitoring, and resource use. A scalable, intelligent robot
        system is needed—capable of responding to real-time changes in
        environment and robot health—through integrated sensing, machine
        learning, and advanced communication technologies.
      </p>

      <h3>Research Objective</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Develop an energy-efficient algorithm that minimizes power consumption
          while ensuring real-time monitoring and secure data transmission
          through edge computing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Design a robotic system with Lidar, and GPS that patrols the
          warehouses autonomously. The route should automatically be updated
          according to environmental conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          A sensor-based system for slave robots enabling adaptive weather and
          AQI prediction, fault detection, and traction control. It uses
          real-time IoT data and a web dashboard to ensure reliable performance
          and autonomous decision-making.
        </li>
        <li>
          An algorithm enabling real-time communication and coordination among
          robots, reducing latency and response time. It also autonomously
          detects incidents and dynamically adjusts patrol routes for enhanced
          coverage.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Methodology</h3>
      <p>
        The system combines Reinforcement Learning for adaptive path planning,
        LIDAR-SLAM for real-time mapping and obstacle avoidance, and
        GPS-waypoint navigation for precise routing. Onboard sensors monitor
        environmental and health data, processed via machine learning for
        predictive insights. Edge computing and IoT enable real-time
        communication, while a distributed coordination system ensures
        efficient, autonomous collaboration among slave robots.
